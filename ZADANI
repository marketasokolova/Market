1 Overview
Welcome to our challenge! This challenge focuses on your general bioinformatics skills.
You may write the code in the programming language of your choice; however, it must
be clearly readable and fully reproducible. You are free to use resources such as online
tutorials, AI tools, and other external materials. However, please ensure that all external
sources are properly referenced.
If anything about the following questions is unclear, or if you have any feedback, please
let us know! Thank you for your time and interest in joining our lab, and good luck!
The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to:
• Inspect and reason about sequencing data
• Automate data processing using the command line or scripting
• Design and execute an appropriate bioinformatics pipeline
• Assess data quality and summarize key statistics
• Communicate your work clearly and reproducibly
There is no single “correct” solution. We are primarily interested in your reasoning,
methodology, and clarity, rather than only the final results.

2 Provided Data
You will receive a directory containing multiple fastq.gz files, representing single-end
amplicon sequencing reads of the 16S rRNA gene from microbial samples.
The 16S rRNA gene is widely used in microbial ecology and taxonomy because it contains
both highly conserved and variable regions. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S gene allows
researchers to profile microbial communities by amplifying and sequencing specific
hypervariable regions, enabling identification and comparison of bacterial taxa across
samples.

Password: BIO2026
Important notes:
• The files originate from two different sequencing platforms.
• The sequencing platform information is not explicitly stated in the file names.
• All files are valid FASTQ files.

3 Task 1: Automated Data Inspection and Sorting
3.1 Objective
Identify the two types of sequencing data and automatically split the FASTQ files into
two separate directories, one per sequencing platform.
Important notes:
• Do not manually inspect files one by one (you can do it for testing, but ultimately,
you need to submit code that automates the process).
• Use command-line tools to analyze the FASTQ files.
• Base your classification on data-derived properties to distinguish the platforms.
3.2 Deliverables
A clear explanation of:
• What properties you inspected
• Why those properties distinguish the two platforms
The code or commands used to:
• Extract the relevant information
• Automatically assign files to one of two directories

4 Task 2: Platform-Specific Bioinformatics Pipeline
4.1 Objective
Choose one of the two sequencing platforms and process only the data from that
platform through a complete bioinformatics pipeline.
You are not given a predefined pipeline. Part of this task is to demonstrate that you can:
• Identify the appropriate analysis steps for the chosen data type.
• Find and justify suitable tools.
4.2 Expected Components
While the exact implementation is up to you, your final report should include:
1. Quality Control
• Describe the data quality

2

• Include relevant QC outputs and interpretations
2. Basic Data Statistics
• Summarize key characteristics of the reads (based on what you consider
relevant).
• Clearly state what you consider “basic statistics” and why
3. Sequence Processing and Feature Inference
Perform the necessary steps to obtain:
• An ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) table
• A taxonomy (TAXA) table
4.3 Output Format
Below are the output formats recommended for the ASV and TAXA tables. Examples
can be found in the provided link along with the input data.
SeqID <SampleName1> <SampleName2> ...
ACGTAA.. 0 30 ...
AGGGCT... 20 120 ...
... ... ... ...
... ... ... ...
Table 1: ASV table structure

SeqID Domain Phylum Class Order .. ..
ACGTAA.. Bacteria Pseudomonadota Gammaproteobacteria Pseudomonadales .. ..
AGGGCT... Bacteria Bacillota Clostridia Oscillospirales .. ..
... ... ... ... .. .. ..
... ... ... ... .. .. ..

5 Task 3: Alpha Diversity Analysis
5.1 Objective

Using the ASV table you generated, compute and visualize alpha diversity across sam-
ples.

5.2 Requirements
You may use any programming language (e.g., R, Python). The choice of alpha diversity
metric(s) and visualization type is up to you. However, you should be able to explain the
details behind the calculations and visualizations.

5.3 Expectations
• Clearly state which diversity metric(s) you selected and why
• Produce at least one meaningful visualization
• Ensure that the code is clear and fully reproducible

6 Code, Reporting, and Submission
6.1 Code
All code must be provided and should be:
• Readable
• Commented where appropriate
• Structured logically
• Reproducible
6.2 Report
Prepare a clear and concise report (in any form you prefer, e.g., Markdown, PDF, HTML,
notebook) describing:
1. Your overall approach
2. Key decisions and assumptions
3. Interpretation of results
6.3 Submission
Upload all code and the report to a GitHub repository. If you wish, you may demonstrate
your Git skills by committing your work incrementally so that the commit history is visible.
If you are new to Git or prefer not to do it, you may upload the final files directly using
the web interface.
The repository link will be provided to you. However, you must have a valid GitHub
account; if you do not already have one, please create it in advance.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
